## DNN or Dermatologist Supporting code:
 * This repository contains all necessary code to replicate the experiments in Deep Neural Networks or Dermatologists?: http://arxiv.org/abs/1908.06612.
 * We suggest to start with train and test set creation. 
 * Then train a suite of models using the data split .py file. 
 * Then produce Kernel SHAP and GradCAM explanations. 
 * Sanity check code is contained in ""
